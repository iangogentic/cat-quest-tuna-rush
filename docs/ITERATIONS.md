# Project Iterations

<!--
This file tracks the history of all iterations (changes) made to the project.
Each entry documents what was changed, when, and the outcome.

Usage:
- Iteration 1 is always the initial build from PRD.md
- Each subsequent iteration gets a new numbered section
- Update status as: 🔄 In Progress → ✅ Complete OR 🔴 Blocked
- Branch names follow format: iter-NNN-description (e.g., iter-002-dark-mode)
